"""Stand-ins for the OpenAI clients, for a machine with no key.

`config/settings_test.py` points ``TRANSCRIPTION_CLIENT`` at
:class:`EchoTranscriptionClient` and ``CLUSTERING_CLIENT`` at
:class:`NullClusteringClient`, so both pipelines run in the suite with no
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, no network, and — this is the point — no test that skips
itself when neither is there. CI fails on a skipped test (AGENTS.md, "CI"), so a
suite that quietly opted out would turn the build red rather than green.

They are kept in the application rather than in `tests/`, for the same reason
`config.tasks.always_fails` is: a Compose stack brought up without a key can
point at them too and watch the pipelines work end to end.

Nothing here is reachable in production unless a ``*_CLIENT`` setting is changed
to name it, which is a deliberate act and not a fallback.
