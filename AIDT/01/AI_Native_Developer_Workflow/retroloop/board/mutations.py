"""The board's writes: seven operations, one transaction each.

Every action the team can take on the board goes through `apply_mutation()`,
which is the whole of the concurrency story:

1. open a transaction;
2. take a row lock on the retrospective;
3. refuse anyone who may not see the project, with the same 404 an id that was
   never used gets;
4. resolve the ids the request names, against *that* retrospective;
5. ask `projects/permissions.py` whether this person may do this now;
6. write;
7. bump `Retrospective.version` — but only if something actually changed;
8. answer with the whole board state, as `board/serializers.py` builds it.

**One lock, and it is the retrospective's.** Everything on this board hangs off
that row, so locking it serialises every mutation on it against every other:
two simultaneous moves both succeed, in some order, and the version ends up two
higher. Nothing here locks a cycle or a card. The project's lock order is
retrospective < cycle < card — `advance_stage()` takes the retrospective's and
then `reveal_cycle()` takes the cycle's — and taking only the first of the three
cannot invert it. `of=("self",)` matters for that: without it the `select_related`
join would lock the cycle and the project rows too, which is exactly the
inversion the order exists to prevent.

**The version moves when the board does, and not otherwise.** `bump_version()`
from #9 is called inside the same transaction as the write it describes, so a
poller is never told to re-read a board that has not changed yet. Every
operation below answers whether it changed anything, and a request that changes
nothing — moving a card to the cluster it is already in, renaming a cluster to
the name it already has — answers False, leaves the counter alone, and does not
wake every other client's poll. It still gets the full state back, so a client
that thought otherwise is corrected.

**A card is named by `Card.public_id` and never by `Card.pk`.**
`_docs/decisions.md` item 9: the primary key is a table-wide sequence, so
sorting one cycle's ids recovers the submission order `cycles/reveal.py` exists
to destroy. `_card_or_404()` parses the value as a UUID and looks the card up by
that column alone. An integer is not a UUID, so it is a 404 — the same answer as
any other id that does not resolve — and there is no branch anywhere in this
module that falls back to a primary-key lookup. There is deliberately no
`filter(pk=` against `Card` here at all: the only `pk` this module hands to the
database is a cluster's, which is an integer by decision.

**A cluster is named by its integer primary key**, and resolved against this
retrospective, so a cluster from another board is a 404 rather than a cluster
somebody else's team is looking at.

Rejections are exceptions with a status on them, because the view's whole job is
to turn one into a response:

- `InvalidRequest` (400) — the request cannot be carried out as written: a blank
  name, a merge of a cluster into itself, a card that is not in the cluster
  being split;
- `BoardFrozen` (409) — the person may not do this to this board now, which in
  practice means the stage has passed CLUSTER and cluster membership is frozen.
  A conflict rather than a 403: nothing is wrong with the caller, their view of
  the board is out of date, and the fix is to re-read it.

Neither is a silent no-op, and neither leaves a partial write behind: they are
raised inside the transaction, so it rolls back.
