"""The record of one meeting handed to the system, and how far it has got.

A `MeetingRecord` is the paperwork around a file that does not survive. The
recording itself lives in the shared scratch volume for as long as the pipeline
needs it and is deleted in a `finally` block by #21 — `_docs/decisions.md` item
6 — so everything here is written on the assumption that the media is already
gone: `temp_path` goes null, `media_deleted_at` is stamped, and a failure is
explained in words rather than offered a retry that could not work.

One rule is held by the database rather than by a view: a retrospective has at
most one record that is not FAILED. Two facilitators uploading at the same
second both pass whatever a view checks, and one of them then loses to a unique
index instead of quietly creating a second pipeline over the same meeting.
