"""The upload page and the fragment it polls.

Both views ask `projects/permissions.py` who this is and `meetings/services.py`
whether the retrospective has got far enough; neither decides anything itself.
The refusals are deliberately different, and each says something true:

* someone who is not on the project gets a 404, the same answer as an id that
  was never used — a 403 would confirm the retrospective exists;
* a member of the project who is not this week's facilitator gets a 403;
* a retrospective that has not reached DISCUSS is not offered the form, and a
  POST to it is refused, because there has been no meeting yet;
* a request whose body is over the cap is refused before it is parsed, so the
  501st megabyte is never read.
