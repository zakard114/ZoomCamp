The retrospective row is deliberately thin. It holds where the retrospective is
(`stage`), when it started and finished, how many votes each member gets, and a
`version` counter that is the whole of the board sync mechanism used by #11 and
#12.

Two things are *not* here on purpose:

- the stage machine. `advance_stage()` lives in `retro/services.py`, because a
  transition is a transaction with side effects and a lock, not an assignment.
  Nothing else may write `stage`;
- any behaviour that depends on cards. Cards arrive with #8; `Cluster` names no
  card, and the relation is `Card.cluster` on the card's side.

    A cluster belongs to the retrospective and not to the cycle: it is made

    ungrouped card is the normal state of every card until someone moves it.

    Two fields exist for issues that are not this one, and are written down here

    - `status` is the discussion state #16 moves a cluster through. #12 creates
      every cluster `PENDING` and never changes it — the transitions are #16's.

    Unlike `Card`, a cluster is addressed publicly by its integer primary key,
    in requests and in the payload alike — `_docs/decisions.md` item 9 is about
    `Card`, and says so: the order clusters were created in is not a fact about
    a person, so a sequence in the payload gives nothing away. A cluster
    deliberately has no `public_id`, and `tests/test_public_id.py` asserts that
    no model but `Card` has one.

    There is no `created_at` either. Nothing needs it — the board is ordered by

    one on another has two rows; a member who piles all three onto one topic has
    a single row with `weight` 3. Withdrawing the last vote from a cluster deletes
    the row rather than leaving a `weight` of 0 behind, so "no votes here" and "a
    row that says zero" are never two ways to spell the same thing.

    This row is the one place the application knows *who* voted for *what*, and it
    never leaves the server as that. `board/serializers.py` reads a member their
    own votes and, from DISCUSS on, per-cluster totals — never another member's
    allocation, at any stage. `_docs/decisions.md` items 2 and 10: the totals are
    hidden while the stage is VOTE precisely because votes are reassignable then,
    and a running total a member could watch move would leak what the secret
    ballot exists to keep.

    `retrospective` is carried explicitly even though `cluster` already implies
    it: the budget is a fact about a member *within a retrospective*, spanning
    every cluster on the board, so the sum that enforces it and the uniqueness
    that shapes it are both keyed by `(retrospective, user)` and read no join to

    resolves the cluster against the retrospective before it ever writes one, so

    `user` is CASCADE, unlike `Card.author` which is SET_NULL: a vote is not the
    team's feedback, it is a transient tally that decides the agenda and is spent
    inside a single stage. A member who leaves takes their votes with them and the
    totals settle without them, rather than leaving an orphan row that counts for
    a person who is gone. There is deliberately no anonymised survival here — a

    Attribution is the whole difference between a note and a card, and it is
    correct here. `_docs/decisions.md` item 10 destroys authorship on cards and
    forbids naming it, because a name on one card identifies the anonymous ones by
    elimination. A note has no anonymous alternative: it is written in a live
    discussion and is already attributable to whoever said it, so naming its
    author eliminates nothing. Item 10 says so in as many words.

    A note attaches to a `cluster` — the topic under discussion — or to nothing,
    which is a note about the retrospective as a whole, which is why `cluster` is

    it. That is the whole point — it is an assigned task, not anonymous feedback,
    so naming the owner is exactly what it is for. The owner is a member of the
    project or nobody (`owner` is nullable): an item can be recorded before it is
    assigned, and #23's extraction leaves it NULL when it cannot resolve a name
    against the roster, or when the name is ambiguous, for the facilitator to
    pick later. An unassigned item is shown, not hidden.

    Like a `Decision` and a `Note` it points at a `cluster` (the topic) or at
    nothing, and never at a `Card`: no card author, no card `pk`, nothing items 9
    and 10 keep off a screen.

    An action item belongs to the one retrospective where it was agreed and is
    never copied into another — `_docs/decisions.md` item 5. The project-wide
    open-actions list (#26) is a live query across retrospectives for
    `status=OPEN`, never a second copy that could drift.

    `status` outlives the retrospective on purpose: after the retrospective is
    COMPLETE its `description` is frozen, but the owner (or the facilitator) can
    still move `status` between OPEN and DONE, because work agreed one week is
    finished in another. Which fields freeze and which stays writable is enforced
    in `projects/permissions.py`: `can_edit_action_item` (text) goes read-only at
    COMPLETE, `can_update_action_item` (the tick box) does not.

    `source` and `review_status` mirror `Decision`: a hand-written item is
    `MANUAL`/`CONFIRMED`, #23 writes `EXTRACTED`/`DRAFT` and #24 promotes it, and
    the columns exist from the first migration so that is not a later migration on
    live rows. `created_by` is the author, exactly as on `Decision`; `owner` is a
    separate field because who wrote the item down and who has to do it are not
    the same person.
