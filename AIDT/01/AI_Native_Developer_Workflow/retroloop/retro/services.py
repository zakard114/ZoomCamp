"""The stage machine: the one place a retrospective's stage ever changes.

`advance_stage()` is the whole public surface. It moves a retrospective forward
by exactly one stage, under a row-level lock, with that transition's side
effects inside the same transaction as the stage write — so a side effect that
raises leaves the stage where it was rather than half-moving the board.

Who may start a retrospective or move it on is decided in
`projects/permissions.py` and asked here. There is deliberately no
`retro/permissions.py`: one module holds the whole application's rules.

The division of labour is fixed: `can_advance_stage` answers *who*, and is
handed no target stage. Forward-only, single-step and `COMPLETE` being terminal
belong to `advance_stage()`, which is the only place both the from-stage and
the to-stage are known.

    Closing the cycle comes first: reveal is the moment collection ends, so

    Then `reveal_cycle()` records participation, shuffles every card's position
    and sets `author` to NULL on the anonymous ones — `_docs/decisions.md` item
    3. It runs here, in `advance_stage()`'s transaction, so the stage write and
    the destruction commit together or not at all. Nothing in it is
    recoverable, which is why it is reached only through a transition the stage
    machine allows exactly once.

    A worker is another process on another connection: a job queued by this
    transaction could be claimed before it commits and read cards that are not
    there yet, or survive a rollback that threw the reveal away. So the enqueue
    waits for the commit, after which the cards are frozen, shuffled and
    anonymised and the job clusters what really landed. The job's own failure
