"""Fixtures the whole suite can ask for.

Right now that is one thing: the front-end assets Node builds. A test that reads
`static/css/app.css` or `static/board/manifest.json` asks for the fixture that
guarantees it, instead of guarding itself with a skip that made a missing build
look like a passing run (#54).

Each fixture is session-scoped, so the npm script behind it runs once per test
session however many tests depend on it. The skipping, the building and the loud
failure all live in `tests/assets.py`, in one place for every artefact.
