"""The board state endpoint: what it returns, and everything it must not.

Every test here maps to an acceptance criterion of issue #11. Four themes run
through them, and they are the reason the file is shaped the way it is.

**Absence is asserted, not presence.** This project has shipped defects past a
green suite because every test asked whether a required string was there and
none asked whether a forbidden one was gone. So the tests below assert that
another member's card text, username, display name, first and last name, and
every card's `created_at`, are missing — from the *raw response body*, not from
a Python object, because the body is what leaks.

**Fields are discovered, not listed.** The sweeps walk the parsed payload to
every depth and judge the keys and values they find. A later issue that adds a
field carrying a timestamp, or an author, fails here without anyone having
remembered to come back and add it to a list.

**The whole body is searched.** A leak in an id, in an ordering, or inside a
nested object is still a leak, so the checks run over the serialized bytes and
over every nested value, not over the fields a UI would draw.

**Nothing is re-decided.** `projects/permissions.py` holds the rules. The card
selection in the serializer is `can_view_card` written as a query, so one test
walks every card at every stage and asserts the two agree, rather than trusting
that they do.

One criterion cannot be fully exercised yet and says so where it is tested:
`Vote` arrives with #15, so the vote totals are empty. What is tested today is
the *gate* — that the totals key does not exist while the stage is `VOTE` and
does from `DISCUSS` — which is the half that leaks if it is wrong.

`Cluster` arrived with #12. The fixtures here still build a board of ungrouped
cards, which is what every board looks like before anyone clusters it, so the
payload assertions below are unchanged and still exact; the clusters in the
payload and the endpoints that put them there are `tests/test_board_mutations.py`.
