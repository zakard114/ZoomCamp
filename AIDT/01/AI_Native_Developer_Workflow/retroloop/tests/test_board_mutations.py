"""The board's seven write endpoints: what they change, and what they refuse.

Every test here maps to an acceptance criterion of issue #12. Five themes run
through the file, and they are the reason it is shaped the way it is.

**The endpoints are driven from a registry.** `ACTIONS` names all seven, with a
body that is valid for each, so the sweeps below — the stage table, access, the
primary key, CSRF, the version — run over every endpoint rather than over the
convenient ones. An endpoint added later without an entry fails
`test_every_write_endpoint_in_the_urlconf_is_exercised` immediately.

**A refusal is proved by attempting it, with a valid CSRF token.** A test that
asserts a 403 for a request the middleware would have refused anyway proves
nothing about the rule it claims to test, so every refusal in this file is
posted through a client that enforces CSRF, carrying a token that works — and
one test proves the token works by getting a 200 with it.

**Absence is asserted, not presence.** A refusal is asserted as *nothing
changed*: every card's cluster, every cluster's fields, the number of cards, the
number of clusters and the version are snapshotted before the request and
compared after it. "Rejected with a 404" and "rejected and acted on anyway" look
identical to a test that only reads the status code.

**A card is named by `Card.public_id`, never by `Card.pk`.**
`_docs/decisions.md` item 9. The pk sweep posts each card's primary key to every
endpoint that takes a card and asserts a 404 with nothing changed — no fallback
to a primary-key lookup, at any endpoint. Clusters are the deliberate
asymmetry: they are named by their integer pk, which the same sweep proves by
using one successfully in the same world.

**Nothing is re-decided.** `projects/permissions.py` holds every rule, including
the five #12 added. The stage table below is the behaviour of the endpoints;
`tests/test_permissions.py` is the behaviour of the predicates, and neither
restates the other's job.
