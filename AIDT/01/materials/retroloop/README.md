# Weekly Team Feedback Tool

A Django app for running weekly Start/Stop/Continue feedback cycles and the
retrospectives that follow them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14
- PostgreSQL 18
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management

## Getting started

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run build:css
uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver
```

Configuration comes entirely from the environment — `DATABASE_URL`,
`SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. In development those are read from
`.env`; in production they are set directly and no `.env` file is shipped.
`SECRET_KEY` has no fallback when `DEBUG` is off: the app refuses to start
rather than run on a default key.

## Frontend assets

Assets are built on the host, not in a container. Node is a build-time tool
only: no image in this project ships a Node runtime, and the app serves nothing
but the files the build leaves behind.

```bash
npm install          # the build-time toolchain: Tailwind CLI and Vite
npm run build:css    # assets/css/app.css -> static/css/app.css
npm run watch:css    # the same, rebuilding as you edit templates
npm run build:js     # assets/js/board.jsx -> static/board/, hashed
npm run watch:js     # the same, rebuilding as you edit the island
```

`static/css/app.css` and `static/board/` are generated and git-ignored, so build
them once after cloning and again after pulling template or island changes.
Tailwind 4 is configured CSS-first inside `assets/css/app.css` — there is no
`tailwind.config.js`.

The retrospective page mounts one React component, built by Vite from
`assets/js/board.jsx`. The bundle's filename carries a content hash, so
templates never name it: `{% vite_bundle "assets/js/board.jsx" %}` reads
`static/board/manifest.json` and renders the script tag. A missing or
unreadable manifest raises an error naming `npm run build:js` rather than
serving a page with a script tag that loads nothing.

htmx and Alpine are committed under `static/vendor/` at pinned versions and
served from this project's own domain. Nothing on a page reaches a CDN.

Compose bind-mounts the working tree into the container, so a stylesheet built
on the host is picked up there without a rebuild.

## Docker Compose

Compose replaces the manual Postgres setup described in "Getting started" — on
a machine with only Docker installed, it brings up the database, the app, and
the background worker:

```bash
docker compose up
docker compose run --rm web uv run manage.py migrate
docker compose run --rm web uv run pytest
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:8000/`. Migrations never run
automatically on container start, so `migrate` is an explicit command. The
`db` service also publishes port 5432, so `uv run pytest` on the host works
against the same database.

Database rows live in a named volume: `docker compose down` keeps them and
`docker compose down -v` discards them. The `worker` service is a placeholder
that idles until the task backend arrives.

## Tests and linting

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

The suite uses `config.settings_test`, which supplies fixed environment values
and then imports the production settings unchanged, so tests need no local
configuration.

## Accounts

There is no email backend anywhere in this project — no verification, no
password reset. A user who forgets their password is reset by an administrator:

```bash
uv run manage.py changepassword <username>
```

## Demo data

`seed_demo` fills a development database with one realistic team so every screen
can be opened and clicked through without running the flow by hand or spending
anything on the OpenAI API:

```bash
uv run manage.py seed_demo
```

It **refuses to run unless `DEBUG` is on** — this is development-only data and
must never be seeded anywhere real. There is no flag or environment variable
that overrides that. Run it again and it deletes the demo projects and users it
owns and rebuilds exactly the same data, touching nothing else.

It creates two projects — `Platform Team` (three weeks of history: a completed
retrospective, a middle one paused at its draft-review screen, and an open
collection week) and `Design Guild` (empty, for the empty-state screens). Every
demo user shares one password, printed on success along with the URLs worth
opening:

| username | display name | role | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `demo_priya` | Priya Raman | owner, facilitator | open most screens as this user |
| `demo_mei` | Mei Lin | facilitator | |
| `demo_sam` | Sam Okafor | member | facilitates cycle 2; the draft-review screen is hers |
| `demo_alex_n` | Alex Novak | member | shares a first name with Alex Turner on purpose |
| `demo_alex_t` | Alex Turner | member | |
| `demo_tom` | Tom Weber | member | submits nothing, so "did not submit" is visible |
| `demo_admin` | Demo Admin | superuser, on no project | opening a demo project gives 404 |

The shared password is **`retro-demo-2026`** (override with `--password`). It is
published here on purpose: this data is disposable and lives only where `DEBUG`
is on. `--seed <int>` produces a different but reproducible dataset.
