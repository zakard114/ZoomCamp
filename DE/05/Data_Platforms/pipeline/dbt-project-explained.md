* the purpose of dbt project

## analyses: 
- A place for SQL files that you don't want to expose	
- I generally use it for data quality reports 
- Lots of people don't use it  

## dbt_project.yml
- The most important file in dbt
- Tell dbt some defaults
- You need it to run dbt commands
- For dbt core, your profile should match the one in the '.dbt/profile'

## macros
- They behave like python functions (reusable logic)
- They help you encapsulate logic (in one place)

## README.md
- The documentation of your project 
- Installation/setup guides
- Contact information

## seeds
- A space to upload csv and flat files (to add them to dbt later)
- Quick and dirty approach (better to fix at source)

## snapshots
- Take a picture of a table at a moment in time
- Useful to track the history of a column that overwrites itself

## tests
- A place to put assertions in SQL format 
- A place for singular tests
- If this SQL command returns more than 0 rows, the dbt build fails


## models
	 
## staging
- Sources (so raw from database)
- Staging files are 1 to 1 copy of your data with minimal cleaning steps:
	- Data types
	- Renaming columns 

## intermediate
- Anything that is not raw nor you want to expose
- No guidelines, just nice for heavy duty cleaning or complex logic

## marts
- If it is in marts, it is ready for consumption 
- Tables ready for dashboards
- Properly modeled, clean tables
