name: setup-secrets
description: Safely manage dlthub secrets in *.secrets.toml. Use when the user directly asks to set up, configure, or inspect credentials (API keys, database passwords, tokens). Also use when writing Python code that needs to read secrets via dlt.secrets without exposing values. Do NOT use for pipeline creation, source discovery, or debugging pipeline execution — those skills call setup-secrets when they need credentials configured.

# Set up dlthub secrets

**Essential Reading** Credentials & config resolution: `https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/setup.md` `https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/advanced`

Configure credentials in `.dlt/secrets.toml`. **Never read secrets files directly** — use `dlt-workspace-mcp` tools or `dlthub ai secrets` CLI commands.

**Prefer MCP** — use `secrets_list`, `secrets_view_redacted`, `secrets_update_fragment` tools from `dlt-workspace-mcp`.

**CLI fallback**: If MCP is not connected, see [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) for equivalent `dlthub ai secrets` commands.

**Read additional docs as needed:**
- Connection string credentials (databases, warehouses): `https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/complex_types.md`
- Built-in credential types (`GcpServiceAccountCredentials`, `AwsCredentials`, etc.): `https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/complex_types.md#built-in-credentials`
- Destination-specific credentials: `https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/`

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `source_name` or description of what credentials are needed (e.g. "stripe api key", "postgres credentials")

## 1. Figure out what to configure

If called from another skill, you already know the source, destination, and which fields are needed — skip to step 3.

If called standalone (e.g. user says "set up secrets" or hit `ConfigFieldMissingException`):
- Read the exception message — it tells you the exact field name and TOML path
- Read the pipeline script to find `dlt.secrets.value` parameters on `@dlt.source`/`@dlt.resource` functions
- Identify the destination type for required credentials

## 2. Find the right secrets file and inspect its shape

Use `secrets_list` to list workspace-scoped secrets files. Profile-scoped files (e.g. `.dlt/dev.secrets.toml`) appear first — **use those when present**, fall back to `.dlt/secrets.toml` otherwise.

**Pick the target file** from the list — you will pass it as `path` to `secrets_update_fragment` in step 4.

Then use `secrets_view_redacted` (no `path` argument) to see the **unified merged** view with values replaced by `***`. To inspect a specific file, pass `path=".dlt/<profile>.secrets.toml"`.

Look for:
- Which sections already exist (`[sources.<name>]`, `[destination.<name>]`)
- Which fields have real values (stars) vs placeholders (`<configure me>`)
- Whether the layout matches what the pipeline expects

Skip this step if you already know the secrets file is empty or doesn't exist.

## 3. Research credentials

Before asking the user for values:
- **Web search** the data source for how credentials are obtained (API docs, developer portal)
- Tell the user exactly what they need and where to get it (e.g. "Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys")
- Explain what each credential field is for

## 4. Write secrets

Use `secrets_update_fragment` with `fragment` (TOML string) and `path` (target file from step 2). Creates the file if needed, deep-merges without overwriting other sections, returns the redacted result.

**CRITICAL: Only write placeholders** — never pass actual secret values through `secrets_update_fragment` or any other tool. The user fills in real values themselves by editing the file directly.

### Layout rules

**Always** scope secrets under the source or destination name:

```toml
[sources.<source_name>]
api_key = "<paste-your-api-key-here>"

[destination.<destination_name>.credentials]
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
database = "analytics"
username = "loader"
password = "<paste-your-password-here>"
```

`<source_name>` = `name=` arg on `@dlt.source`, or the function name if not set.

### Placeholders

Use **meaningful placeholders** that hint at the format:
- API keys: `"sk-*****-your-key"` or `"ak-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"`
- Tokens: `"ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"` (GitHub), `"xoxb-xxxx"` (Slack)
- Passwords: `"<paste-your-password-here>"`
- URLs: `"https://your-instance.example.com"`

**Never** use the generic `"<configure me>"`.

## 5. Verify

Use `secrets_view_redacted` to see the unified merged view across all workspace secret files. Tell the user which fields still have placeholders and how to obtain real values.


## 6. Use secrets in Python
You can write Python scripts that read and use secrets without ever revealing them. `dlt.secrets` and `dlt.config` work as dictionaries using the same TOML paths shown by `view-redacted`.

Example: you need to call the GitHub REST API and `view-redacted` shows `[sources.github] api_key = "***"`:
```py
import dlt
import requests

# reads from secrets.toml [sources.github] api_key — never prints the value
api_key = dlt.secrets["sources.github.api_key"]
resp = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/user",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
)
print(resp.json()["login"])
```

You can also retrieve typed credentials:
```py
from dlt.sources.credentials import GcpServiceAccountCredentials

creds = dlt.secrets.get("destination.bigquery.credentials", GcpServiceAccountCredentials)
```
